Background: We have artists create large frame sequences at 17280x3240 resolution. They're stored on one network location in a folder structure /source/to/location/src_frames. Our task is to split the frames up into 27 individual 1920x1080 frames each, and montage for display on 27 monitors.

Purpose: Mainly python practice. This automates some manual editing and file creation when submitting multiple Rush Renders from the same directory. Perviously, submitting multiple jobs to be rendered at the same time required:

1. Creating a HOPE_ClimateWall file for each job. 
2. Creating a HOPE_ClimateWall_render file for each job. 
3. Creating a RUSH_SUBMIT file for each job. 
4. Editing each of these three files with names, frame counts, titles, and render commands individually.  
5. Submit each submission file individually. 

While my setup definitely is not perfect or pretty, it does automate specific portions of 1-5 by taking the user input from multi_rush.py and executing the new submission scripts. Source file names are always have the same root name as the parent folder, i.e. /home/mcarroll/multi_submit_test_1/CO2_042618_2/src_frames/CO2_042618_2.00400.png 

Contributions: multi_rush.py and open_write.py are 100% my work. multi_python_rush_submit.py is adapted from a template which can be found here http://seriss.com/rush-current/rush/rush-submit.html#Python-Simple. multi_HOPE_ClimateWall_render is built from a template found here http://seriss.com/rush-current/rush/rush-render.html. multi_HOPE_ClimateWall was not written by me. 
 
 Example: 
 
 I copied 3 versions of artist frames here: 
 /home/mcarroll/multi_submit_test_1/CO2_042618_1/src_frames
 /home/mcarroll/multi_submit_test_1/CO2_042618_2/src_frames
 /home/mcarroll/multi_submit_test_1/CO2_042618_3/src_frames
 
 When I run the following command and add my input, the scripts are created and submitted to our render farm. The render farm will write newly sliced frames to the proper location. 
 
(dgp) mcarroll@zinc:[~/bin/rush]$ python multi_rush.py 
New directory for these scripts will be created here /home/mcarroll/bin/rush. Name the directory without using the date and surround in quotations. "scripts"
How many jobs will you be rendering? No quotations. 3
[JOB #1] What is the frame name root? ($idir/$name.$i.$iext). Put inside quotations "CO2_042618_1"
[JOB #1] What would you like to name your render? Put inside quotations "CO2_042618_1"
[JOB #1] What is the frame range? Format = X-XXX. Put in quotations "0-399"
[JOB #2] What is the frame name root? ($idir/$name.$i.$iext). Put inside quotations "CO2_042618_2"
[JOB #2] What would you like to name your render? Put inside quotations "CO2_042618_2"
[JOB #2] What is the frame range? Format = X-XXX. Put in quotations "400-799"
[JOB #3] What is the frame name root? ($idir/$name.$i.$iext). Put inside quotations "CO2_042618_3"
[JOB #3] What would you like to name your render? Put inside quotations "CO2_042618_3"
[JOB #3] What is the frame range? Format = X-XXX. Put in quotations "800-1200"
